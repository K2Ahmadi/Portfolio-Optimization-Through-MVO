# Portfolio-Optimization-Through-MVO
The objective of this project is to utilize Markowitz mean-variance optimization (MVO) to allocate funds among a group of assets in order to generate the highest possible performance. Here, "performance" refers to maximizing returns, minimizing risks, or maximizing the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio).


The dataset consists of monthly closing prices for 25 assets from Jan 1st, 2018, to Dec 1st, 2020 (in-sample) and closing prices for the same assets in 2021 (out-of-sample).
